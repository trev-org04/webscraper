# Simple Python Webscraper

This is a simple webscraper I created using the Selenium package in Python. It scrapes a list of bank names from a website and creates a sheet for each bank in an Excel file. Then, it scrapes the routing numbers and locations of the bank branches for each bank and places that information into the appropriate sheet. The output file (named 'Bank List.xls') is the result of running this script.
